I am a software developer based in Toronto who is passionate about functional
programming, particularly Haskell. I did my undergraduate degree in Philosophy
focusing on epistemology, philosophy of law, and ethics. I am interested in
Type Theory and how academic ideas can be put to work solving applied problems.
I used to run the Toronto Haskell Meetup.
