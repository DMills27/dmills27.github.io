- Axiom of extension: Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.
    - Sets are characterized by their set membership predicate, there's nothing
      other than that. This is what extensionality says: sets are equivalent if
      their set membership predicates are equal)
- Inclusion and belonging are very different (inclusion is reflexive, but belonging is not obviously reflexive)
- "Sets have a special connection to predicates because sets are both "the
domain of discourse" that predicates can embed into a logical framework AND
sets are themselves defined by predicates (a special predicate called
"membership")"
