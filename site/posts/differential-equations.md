When I was a grad student I spent quite a bit of time thinking about how to solve some very difficult differential equations. I remember one thing that stuck out to me was how what I learnt in the undergraduate differential equations class didn't really help me that much in grad school, in the sense that many of the problems I solved in undergrad were pretty mechanical and didn't involve much more abstract and sophisticated reasoning that lent itself well to more higher-level mathematics. For example, the notion of compactness that you'd study in a basic topology class is very useful in graduate level courses such as Functional Analysis, Dynamical Systems and Algebraic Geometry. The same can be said about concepts that you'd learn about in a beginner's Abstract Algebra class such as groups which I actually find a much ultility as a delve more and more into functional programming in my personal and professional life.
