\p{
This is my personal set of notes inspired by
[stacks](https://www.jonmsterling.com/stacks-project.xml), [evergreen
notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), and
[zettelkasten](https://jonathanlorimer.dev/posts/smart-notes-review.html). This
page is intended to be the primary index and links out to other index cards
that are concept specific.
